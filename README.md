# Improving-3D-MRI-Image-Diagnostics-with-Synthetic-Data

This Deep Learning project employs a CNN and DFNN to classify MRI Images for medical diagnosis. My focus was on the creation of a GAN to 1) generate additional training samples and 2) use generative learning to key in on the differentiable features between positive cases and controls.
